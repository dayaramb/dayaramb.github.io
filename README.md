## Pentest make easy

The purspose of this site is to make the Penetration testing and Privilege escation make easy. There are several exploits and various writeup avilable. But when it is needed its very difficult to find out the exact exploit and the writeup.

In this site I am attempting to collect most of the common exploits that appear in CTF and other exinvornments.


### Random Exploit collection

Here I am collectign some of the random exploits and their exploitation technqiues. Later I will categorised and group them to each group.

| Application Name | CVE | Scenario | Working Exploits | Reverse Shell | Writeup and Reference |
