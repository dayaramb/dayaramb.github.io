## Variables in Linear Regression

In any linear regression model, the variables are split into two categories: what you know (X) and what you want to predict (Y).

### **X Variable: The Input**

The **X variable** represents the input or the information you are using to make a prediction. It's the cause in a cause-and-effect relationship.

Other common names for the X variable include:
* **Features**
* Explanatory Variable
* Independent Variable
* Predictor Variable
* Input Variable

### **Y Variable: The Output**

The **Y variable** is what you are trying to predict. Its value is dependent on the X variable(s). It's the effect in a cause-and-effect relationship.

Other common names for the Y variable include:
* **Label**
* Outcome Variable
* Dependent Variable
* Target Variable
* Response Variable
